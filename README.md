# My-Grocery-List

My plan is to build an application in Java called My Grocery List. The app itself should look something like this: 1. If you open an app you will see the button (Add first item) When you click on this button an alert dialogue will pop up where you can enter grocery item and quantity. When you save it will save the product and quantity and add it to your grocery list.( For example: Banana, qty:3, date when the following product was added and right next to the product there are x icon and when hitting it it will delete the product from your grocery list. Grocery list will be implemented in recycler view. On Grocery list view there is a floating button where you can add new products to your grocery list. As we are keep adding products to our Grocery list then our grocery list recycler view will be populated dynamically.The database i will be implementing would most probably be SQLite. (Not sure at the moment.) My idea is start working on the app and put 2-3 hours into the project daily for the next four weeks and hopefully publishing my app to Google Play. Will see if i can manage it or have to retake the whole class next year :))
